# Augmented RSPECT Dataset

 
This dataset augments the RSNA Pulmonary Embolism CT dataset through bounding box annotation of pulmonary emboli and specific anatomical localization within the pulmonary arterial vascular tree. 

The paper describing the construction of the augmented dataset and usage guide can be found at: [Matias F. Callejas, Hui-Ming Lin, Thomas Howard, Matthew Aitken, Marc Napoleone, Laura Jimenez-Juan, Robert Moreland, Shobhit Mathur, Djeven P. Deva, and Errol Colak.
